# Windows_File_Cap_Alert
A powershell program allowing you to set or update file cap in specified folder

The inspiration was drawn from a painful experience where I have to manually check how many files I have in a local folder every now and then to aviod an excess of files as there isn't many memory left on my hard drive. Of course, I could have put it in a OneDrive folder where files will be automatically synced. However, I am using 百度云盘 in this case, a free cloud service in China. 

Database system is MS SQL Server hosted on my local machine. 

There are still areas I want to improve, like the appearance of the GUI version, as well as features I want to introduce, such as automating the login verfication process once extra files need to be uploaded to cloud after a file cap is exceeded. 

To be updated...
